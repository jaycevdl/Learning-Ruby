# Learning Ruby 

This is my first time learning a programming language from the extreme basics. After I attended a [Code Retreat](http://coderetreat.org/about) I thought it would be good to learn right from the basics to have a complete understanding of the programming language _Ruby_

Links to look at if you are considering Ruby:
